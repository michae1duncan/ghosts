At least, that’s what about half of the 8,000 or so Piping Plovers do. The whereabouts of the other half of the population has long been unknown, but now scientists are starting to solve the mystery. In 2011, an international team of shorebird biologists, including Audubon scientists, discovered more than 1,000 plovers wintering in the Bahamas.<br><br>While many conservation efforts have focused on safeguarding the birds’ breeding habitat, we now know that plovers spend nearly two-thirds of the year outside these areas. And research shows that even a small drop in the number of birds that survive the winter can threaten the recovery of the species.

Plovers depend on a variety of habitat types, including sand bars, tidal flats, and gently sloping beaches. During high tide, they rest above the water line, catching their breath before taking off for the next leg of their journey. When the tide recedes, plovers flock to the exposed sand flats and refuel on worms and crustaceans. As with their breeding sites, the primary threats are from habitat loss and disturbance.
